The main mechanics:

Walking around with a flashlight
Not being able to see behind you without turning around

Ideas:

Different flashlight lenses
Ghosts you can only see with your flashlight, but then the flashlight stops working for a bit as soon as you shine it on them
Spotting certain clues in blacklight, spotting other clues in regular light, spotting some things only with your light turned off
Maybe a red light as well

Changes to try:

Taller vertical resolution so you can't cover the whole area easily with your light
Darker canvas modulation (pitch black?)

More mechanics needed:

Interacting with stuff!

Story thoughts:

- Why are you exploring somewhere spooky in the dark?
- What is this place?
- What danger is there?
- What will you have to accomplish?
- What will you have to do to survive?
- What obstacles are in your way?
- What themes are we exploring?
